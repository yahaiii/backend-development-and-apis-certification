# A repo of my journey to the Free Code Camp Back End Development and APIs Certification

Welcome to my journey to the Free Code Camp Back End Development and APIs Certification! This repository is a collection of my work and progress throughout the course. 

Throughout this course, I will be working on different challenges that cover the following topics:
- Node.js and Express
- MongoDB and Mongoose
- Authentication and Authorization
- RESTful APIs
- Advanced Node.js and Express

I will be building functional applications that demonstrate my understanding of the concepts covered in each challenge. 

## My Progress
1. **Node.js and Express:** Building a simple web server using Node and Express
2. **MongoDB and Mongoose:** Connecting a MongoDB database to a Node.js application using Mongoose
3. **Authentication and Authorization:** Implementing user authentication and authorization using JSON Web Tokens (JWT)
4. **RESTful APIs:** Designing and building a RESTful API 
5. **Advanced Node.js and Express:** Using advanced features of Node and Express to build more complex and scalable applications.
